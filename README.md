The error indicates that your application tried to open a browser window automatically, but the `xdg-open` utility, which is commonly used in Linux environments to open URLs, is missing inside your Docker container.

### Steps to Resolve:

1. **Install `xdg-utils` in the Docker Container**:
   If you want to use `xdg-open`, ensure it's installed in the container:
   - Attach to the container:
     ```bash
     docker exec -it f5e5e52e6436 bash
     ```
   - Install `xdg-utils`:
     ```bash
     apt-get update && apt-get install -y xdg-utils
     ```
   - Restart the container or the application.

2. **Disable Auto-Browser Opening**:
   Modify your `start` script in `package.json` to avoid attempting to open the browser automatically:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "react-scripts start --no-open"
   }
   ```
   Then rebuild the Docker image and restart the container.

3. **Access the Application Manually**:
   - The logs indicate the app is running at `http://172.17.0.2:3000`.
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://<docker-host-IP>:3000`. If you're running Docker on a local machine, replace `<docker-host-IP>` with `localhost`.

4. **Update npm (Optional)**:
   The logs also suggest upgrading npm:
   ```bash
   npm install -g npm@latest
   ```
   This isn't mandatory to fix the issue but is good for keeping dependencies up to date.
